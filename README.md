# SBC-rpi-pico-w-nfc-based-access-control-system

I designed and developed a `NFC-Based Access Control System for Restricted and Secure Door Entry Solutions Using Raspberry Pi Pico W`  by leveraging the functionality of the PN532 NFC reader and Tags (cards), LED as indicators, LCD1604, Buzzer, and a Servo Motor.

***Note:*** If recreating the same work, consider to copy and paste all files in this repository into your Rasberry Pi Pico W's root directory, while the ```code.py``` is the main code, while other codes are for each functionality test.
